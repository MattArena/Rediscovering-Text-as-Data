## 1) Summary

Write one sentence summarizing the article.

## 2) Level of Engagement

At what level does the author of the article engage with the primary source? Does the author address the contemporary culture? The text itself? Specific characters? The life of the primary text's author? The meaning of the text? An allegory? Character relationships? Formal characteristics (rhyme, meter, etc.)?

## 3) Argument/Stakes

What is ultimately the author's argument? Why does it matter? What's at stake? What contribution does the article make? What would we be missing if the article wasn't written?

## 4) Method

Especially in the Digital Humanities, most papers will employ a specific (computational) method. Network analysis? Topic modeling? Clustering? Classification? Dictionary? Simply counting?

## 5) Issues

What are some issues with the author's argument? What do you see as a potential flaw or bias? Is the author's argument limited by anything (method, corpus, etc.)? Do you have any solutions?

## 6) Reproducibility/Transparency

Having read the article, could you start from zero, go step-by-step and come to the same conclusion? Provided the data, could you write code to produce the same results? Are the code and data provided and easily accessible? Is the method described in detail?

This applies more to the data analysis than the humanistic conclusion.

## 7) Broader Application

Think about broadening the stakes of the argument. How could this method be applied to other disciplines or in industry?
