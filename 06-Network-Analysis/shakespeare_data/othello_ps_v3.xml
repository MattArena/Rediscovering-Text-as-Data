<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly</line>
<line form="verse">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</line>
<line form="verse">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line form="verse">&#8217;Sblood, but you&#8217;ll not hear me.</line>

<line form="verse">Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</line>
<line form="verse">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</line>
<line form="verse">Off-capp&#8217;d to him; and, by the faith of man,</line>
<line form="verse">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</line>
<line form="verse">But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)</line>
<line form="verse">Evades them with a bumbast circumstance</line>
<line form="verse">Horribly stuff&#8217;d with epithites of war,</line>
<line form="verse">And in conclusion,</line>
<line form="verse">Nonsuits my mediators; for, &#8220;Certes,&#8221; says he,</line>
<line form="verse">&#8220;I have already chose my officer.&#8221;</line>
<line form="verse">And what was he?</line>
<line form="verse">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</line>
<line form="verse">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine</line>
<line form="verse">(A fellow almost damn&#8217;d in a fair wife),</line>
<line form="verse">That never set a squadron in the field,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor the division of a battle knows</line>
<line form="verse">More than a spinster&#8212;unless the bookish theoric,</line>
<line form="verse">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</line>
<line form="verse">As masterly as he. Mere prattle, without practice,</line>
<line form="verse">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th&#8217; election;</line>
<line form="verse">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</line>
<line form="verse">At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</line>
<line form="verse">Christen&#8217;d and heathen, must be belee&#8217;d and calm&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">By debitor and creditor&#8212;this counter&#8212;caster,</line>
<line form="verse">He (in good time!) must his lieutenant be,</line>
<line form="verse">And I (God bless the mark!) his Moorship&#8217;s ancient.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line form="verse">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Why, there&#8217;s no remedy. &#8217;Tis the curse of service;</line>
<line form="verse">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</line>
<line form="verse">And not by old gradation, where each second</line>
<line form="verse">Stood heir to th&#8217; first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</line>
<line form="verse">Whether I in any just term am affin&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">To love the Moor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="4">I would not follow him then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line form="verse">O, sir, content you;</line>
<line form="verse">I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</line>
<line form="verse">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</line>
<line form="verse">Cannot be truly follow&#8217;d. You shall mark</line>
<line form="verse">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</line>
<line form="verse">That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)</line>
<line form="verse">Wears out his time, much like his master&#8217;s ass,</line>
<line form="verse">For nought but provender, and when he&#8217;s old, cashier&#8217;d.</line>
<line form="verse">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</line>
<line form="verse">Who, trimm&#8217;d in forms and visages of duty,</line>
<line form="verse">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</line>
<line form="verse">And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</line>
<line form="verse">Do well thrive by them; and when they have lin&#8217;d their coats,</line>
<line form="verse">Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</line>
<line form="verse">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</line>
<line form="verse">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</line>
<line form="verse">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.</line>
<line form="verse">In following him, I follow but myself;</line>
<line form="verse">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</line>
<line form="verse">But seeming so, for my peculiar end;</line>
<line form="verse">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</line>
<line form="verse">The native act and figure of my heart</line>
<line form="verse">In complement extern, &#8217;tis not long after</line>
<line form="verse">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</line>
<line form="verse">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line form="verse">What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe</line>

<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="4">Call up her father.</line>
<line form="verse">Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</line>
<line form="verse">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</line>
<line form="verse">And though he in a fertile climate dwell,</line>
<line form="verse">Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</line>

<line form="verse">Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</line>
<line form="verse">Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</line>

<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line form="prose">&#8217;Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, You&#8217;ll have your daughter cover&#8217;d with a Barbary horse, You&#8217;ll have your nephews neigh to you; You&#8217;ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.</line>

<line form="verse">Sir, I will answer any thing. But I beseech you,</line>
<line form="verse">If&#8217;t be your pleasure and most wise consent</line>
<line form="verse">(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,</line>
<line form="verse">At this odd-even and dull watch o&#8217; th&#8217; night,</line>
<line form="verse">Transported with no worse nor better guard</line>
<line form="verse">But with a knave of common hire, a gundolier,</line>
<line form="verse">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">If this be known to you, and your allowance,</line>
<line form="verse">We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</line>
<line form="verse">But if you know not this, my manners tell me</line>
<line form="verse">We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</line>
<line form="verse">That, from the sense of all civility,</line>
<line form="verse">I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</line>
<line form="verse">Your daughter (if you have not given her leave),</line>
<line form="verse">I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</line>
<line form="verse">Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</line>
<line form="verse">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</line>
<line form="verse">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself.</line>
<line form="verse">If she be in her chamber or your house,</line>

<line form="verse" offset="4">Farewell; for I must leave you.</line>
<line form="verse">It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</line>
<line form="verse">To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall)</line>
<line form="verse">Against the Moor; for I do know the state</line>
<line form="verse">(How ever this may gall him with some check)</line>
<line form="verse">Cannot with safety cast him, for he&#8217;s embark&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars</line>
<line form="verse">(Which even now stands in act) that, for their souls,</line>
<line form="verse">Another of his fathom they have none</line>
<line form="verse">To lead their business; in which regard,</line>
<line form="verse">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,</line>
<line form="verse">Yet, for necessity of present life,</line>
<line form="verse">I must show out a flag and sign of love,</line>

Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up tine, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manur&#8217;d with industry&#8212;why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the beam of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost&#8217;rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.</line>

Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurp&#8217;d beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor&#8212;put money in thy purse&#8212;nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration&#8212;put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills&#8212;fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang&#8217;d in compassing thy joy than to be drown&#8217;d and go without her.</line>

Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be deliver&#8217;d.

To love him still for prating&#8212;let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties&#8212;all which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these requir&#8217;d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus&#8217;d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc&#8217;d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none&#8212;a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.</line>
