<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>And I in going, madam, weep  o&#8217;er my father&#8217;s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty&#8217;s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>What hope is there of his Majesty&#8217;s amendment?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>He hath abandon&#8217;d his physicians, madam, under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>This young gentlewoman had a father&#8212;O, that &#8220;had,&#8221; how sad a passage &#8217;tis!&#8212;whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch&#8217;d so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the King&#8217;s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the King&#8217;s disease.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>How call&#8217;d you the man you speak of, madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so&#8212;Gerard de Narbon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>He was excellent indeed, madam. The King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly. He was skillful enough to have liv&#8217;d still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>A fistula, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>I heard not of it before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>His sole child, my lord, and bequeath&#8217;d to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity: they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line>How understand we that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNT.</speaker>
<line>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</line>
<line>In manners as in shape! Thy blood and virtue</line>
<line>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</line>
<line>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</line>
<line>Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy</line>
<line>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</line>
<line>Under thy own life&#8217;s key. Be check&#8217;d for silence,</line>
<line>But never tax&#8217;d for speech. What heaven more will,</line>
<line>That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,</line>
<line>Fall on thy head!&#8212;Farewell, my lord.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis an unseason&#8217;d courtier, good my lord,</line>
<line>Advise him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAF.</speaker>
<line offset="3">He cannot want the best</line>
<line>That shall attend his love.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>O, were that all! I think not on my father,</line>
<line>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</line>
<line>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</line>
<line>I have forgot him. My imagination</line>
<line>Carries no favor in&#8217;t but Bertram&#8217;s.</line>
<line>I am undone, there is no living, none,</line>
<line>If Bertram be away. &#8217;Twere all one</line>
<line>That I should love a bright particular star</line>
<line>And think to wed it, he is so above me.</line>
<line>In this bright radiance and collateral light</line>
<line>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</line>
<line>Th&#8217; ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</line>
<line>The hind that would be mated by the lion</line>
<line>Must die for love. &#8217;Twas pretty, though a plague,</line>
<line>To see him every hour, to sit and draw</line>
<line>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</line>
<line>In our heart&#8217;s table&#8212;heart too capable</line>
<line>Of every line and trick of his sweet favor.</line>
<line>But now he&#8217;s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</line>
<line>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</line>

<stagedir type="enter">Enter Parolles.</stagedir>

<stagedir type="aside">Aside.</stagedir>
<line>One that goes with him. I love him for his sake,</line>
<line>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</line>
<line>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</line>
<line>Yet these fix&#8217;d evils sit so fit in him,</line>
<line>That they take place when virtue&#8217;s steely bones</line>
<line>Looks bleak i&#8217; th&#8217; cold wind. Withal, full oft we see</line>
<line>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Save you, fair queen!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>And you, monarch!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>No.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>And no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>Are you meditating on virginity?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricade it against him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>Keep him out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>But he assails, and our virginity though valiant, in the defense yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>There is none. Man, setting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. &#8217;Tis too cold a companion; away with&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>I will stand for&#8217;t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s little can be said in&#8217;t, &#8217;tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose by&#8217;t. Out with&#8217;t! Within t&#8217; one year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne&#8217;er it likes. &#8217;Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying: the longer kept, the less worth. Off with&#8217;t while &#8217;tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable&#8212;just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither&#8217;d pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry, &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear; it was formerly better, marry, yet &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear. Will you any thing with it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Not my virginity yet:</line>
<line>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</line>
<line>A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,</line>
<line>A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,</line>
<line>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</line>
<line>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</line>
<line>His humble ambition, proud humility;</line>
<line>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet;</line>
<line>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</line>
<line>Of pretty, fond, adoptions christendoms</line>
<line>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he&#8212;</line>
<line>I know not what he shall&#8212;God send him well!</line>
<line>The court&#8217;s a learning place, and he is one&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>What one, i&#8217; faith?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>That I wish well. &#8217;Tis pity&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s pity?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>That wishing well had not a body in&#8217;t,</line>
<line>Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born,</line>
<line>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</line>
<line>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</line>
<line>And show what we alone must think, which never</line>
<line>Returns us thanks.</line>

<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s for advantage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety. But the composition that your valor and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier&#8217;s counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So farewell.</line>

<line>Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.</line>
<line>What power is it which mounts my love so high,</line>
<line>That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?</line>
<line>The mightiest space in fortune nature brings</line>
<line>To join like likes, and kiss like native things.</line>
<line>Impossible be strange attempts to those</line>
<line>That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose</line>
<line>What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove</line>
<line>To show her merit, that did miss her love?</line>

<line>I would I had that corporal soundness now</line>

<line>But on us both did haggish age steal on,</line>
<line>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</line>
<line>To talk of your good father. In his youth</line>
<line>He had the wit which I can well observe</line>
<line>Today in our young lords; but they may jest</line>
<line>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</line>
<line>Ere they can hide their levity in honor.</line>
<line>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</line>
<line>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</line>
<line>His equal had awak&#8217;d them, and his honor,</line>
<line>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</line>
<line>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</line>
<line>His tongue obey&#8217;d his hand. Who were below him</line>

<line>Y&#8217; are shallow, madam&#8212;in great friends, for the knaves come to do that for me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to inn the crop. If I be his cuckold, he&#8217;s my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage, for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome&#8217;er their hearts are sever&#8217;d in religion, their heads are both one: they may jowl horns together like any deer i&#8217; th&#8217; herd.</line>

<speaker>STEW.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish&#8217;d me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touch&#8217;d not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she lov&#8217;d your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris&#8217;d without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she deliver&#8217;d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e&#8217;er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal, sithence in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.</line>

<line>Your salt tears&#8217; head, now to all sense &#8217;tis gross:</line>

<line>Confess it, t&#8217; one to th&#8217; other, and thine eyes</line>
<line>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors</line>
<line>That in their kind they speak it. Only sin</line>

<line>I know I love in vain, strive against hope;</line>
<line>Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</line>

<line>And lack not to lose still. Thus Indian-like,</line>
<line>Religious in mine error, I adore</line>
<line>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,</line>
<line>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</line>
<line>Let not your hate encounter with my love</line>
<line>For loving where you do; but if yourself,</line>
<line>Whose aged honor cites a virtuous youth,</line>
<line>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</line>

<line>The rather will I spare my praises towards him,</line>
<line>Knowing him is enough. On &#8217;s bed of death</line>
<line>Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,</line>
<line>Which as the dearest issue of his practice,</line>
<line>And of his old experience th&#8217; only darling,</line>
<line>He bade me store up, as a triple eye,</line>
<line>Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so,</line>
<line>And hearing your high Majesty is touch&#8217;d</line>
<line>With that malignant cause wherein the honor</line>
<line>Of my dear father&#8217;s gift stands chief in power,</line>
<line>I come to tender it, and my appliance,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="6">We thank you, maiden,</line>

<line>From her inaidible estate; I say we must not</line>
<line>So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</line>
<line>To prostitute our past-cure malady</line>
<line>To empirics, or to dissever so</line>
<line>Our great self and our credit, to esteem</line>
<line>A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>My duty then shall pay me for my pains.</line>

<line>I cannot give thee less, to be call&#8217;d grateful.</line>
<line>Thou thought&#8217;st to help me, and such thanks I give</line>

<line>What I can do can do no hurt to try,</line>
<line>Since you set up your rest &#8217;gainst remedy.</line>
<line>He that of greatest works is finisher</line>
<line>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</line>
<line>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</line>
<line>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</line>
<line>From simple sources; and great seas have dried</line>
<line>When miracles have by the great&#8217;st been denied.</line>
<line>Oft expectation fails, and most oft there</line>
<line>Where most it promises; and oft it hits</line>
<line>Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid,</line>

<line>I am not an imposture that proclaim</line>

<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis only title thou disdain&#8217;st in her, the which</line>
<line>I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</line>
<line>Of color, weight, and heat, pour&#8217;d all together,</line>
<line>Would quite confound distinction, yet stands off</line>
<line>In differences so mighty. If she be</line>
<line>All that is virtuous&#8212;save what thou dislik&#8217;st,</line>
<line>A poor physician&#8217;s daughter&#8212;thou dislik&#8217;st</line>
<line>Of virtue for the name. But do not so.</line>
<line>From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,</line>
<line>The place is dignified by th&#8217; doer&#8217;s deed.</line>
<line>Where great additions swell &#8217;s, and virtue none,</line>
<line>It is a dropsied honor. Good alone</line>
<line>Is good, without a name; vileness is so:</line>
<line>The property by what it is should go,</line>
<line>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair,</line>
<line>In these to nature she&#8217;s immediate heir;</line>
<line>And these breed honor. That is honor&#8217;s scorn,</line>
<line>Which challenges itself as honor&#8217;s born,</line>
<line>And is not like the sire. Honors thrive,</line>
<line>When rather from our acts we them derive</line>
<line>Than our foregoers. The mere word&#8217;s a slave</line>
<line>Debosh&#8217;d on every tomb, on every grave</line>
<line>A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</line>
<line>Where dust and damn&#8217;d oblivion is the tomb</line>
<line>Of honor&#8217;d bones indeed. What should be said?</line>
<line>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</line>
<line>I can create the rest. Virtue and she</line>
<line>Is her own dower; honor and wealth from me.</line>

<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>My honor&#8217;s at the stake, which to defeat,</line>

<line>Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,</line>
<line>That dost in vile misprision shackle up</line>
<line>My love and her desert; that canst not dream,</line>
<line>We poising us in her defective scale,</line>
<line>Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know</line>
<line>It is in us to plant thine honor where</line>
<line>We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;</line>
<line>Obey our will, which travails in thy good;</line>
<line>Believe not thy disdain, but presently</line>
<line>Do thine own fortunes that obedient right</line>
<line>Which both thy duty owes and our power claims,</line>
<line>Or I will throw thee from my care forever</line>
<line>Into the staggers and the careless lapse</line>
<line>Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate</line>
<line>Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,</line>
<line>Without all terms of pity. Speak, thine answer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit</line>
<line>My fancy to your eyes. When I consider</line>
<line>What great creation and what dole of honor</line>
<line>Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late</line>
<line>Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now</line>
<line>The praised of the King, who so ennobled,</line>
<line>Is as &#8217;twere born so.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Nay, good my lord, put him to&#8217;t; let him have his way.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>On my life, my lord, a bubble.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Do you think I am so far deceiv&#8217;d in him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he&#8217;s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship&#8217;s entertainment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>It were fit you knew him, lest reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination, if he do not, for the promise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for&#8217;t. When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in&#8217;t, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum&#8217;s entertainment, your inclining cannot be remov&#8217;d. Here he comes.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir type="enter">Enter Parolles.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honor of his design. Let him fetch off his drum in any hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>How now, <french xml:lang="fr">monsieur</french>? This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>A pox on&#8217;t, let it go, &#8217;tis but a drum.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>But a drum! Is&#8217;t but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command&#8212;to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>That was not to be blam&#8217;d in the command of the service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success. Some dishonor we had in the loss of that drum, but it is not to be recover&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>It might have been recover&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>It might, but it is not now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>It is to be recover&#8217;d. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or hic jacet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Why, if you have a stomach, to&#8217;t, <french xml:lang="fr">monsieur</french>: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honor again into his native quarter, be magnanimious in the enterprise and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it, and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>But you must not now slumber in it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll about it this evening, and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>I know th&#8217; art valiant, and to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee. Farewell.</line>

<line>I love not many words.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir type="exit">Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done, damns himself to do, and dares better be damn&#8217;d than to do&#8217;t?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man&#8217;s favor, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>None in the world, but return with an invention, and clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost emboss&#8217;d him, you shall see his fall tonight; for indeed he is not for your lordship&#8217;s respect.</line>

<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smok&#8217;d by the old Lord Lafew. When his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him, which you shall see this very night.</line>

<line>When you are dead, you should be such a one</line>

<line>If I should swear by Jove&#8217;s great attributes</line>
<line>I lov&#8217;d you dearly, would you believe my oaths</line>
<line>When I did love you ill? This has no holding,</line>
<line>To swear by Him whom I protest to love</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>You have not given him his mother&#8217;s letter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>I have deliv&#8217;red it an hour since. There is something in&#8217;t that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang&#8217;d almost into another man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Especially he hath incurr&#8217;d the everlasting displeasure of the King, who had even tun&#8217;d his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>When you have spoken it, &#8217;tis dead, and I am the grave of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honor. He hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Now God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorr&#8217;d ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream  o&#8217;erflows himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company tonight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company anatomiz&#8217;d, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>I hear there is an overture of peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I assure you a peace concluded.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>What will Count Roussillion do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his counsel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Let it be forbid, sir, so should I be a great deal of his act.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish&#8217;d; and there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>How is this justified?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm&#8217;d by the rector of the place.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Hath the Count all this intelligence?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.</line>

<line>I am heartily sorry that he&#8217;ll be glad of this.</line>

<line>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valor hath here acquir&#8217;d for him shall at home be encount&#8217;red with a shame as ample.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipt them not, and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherish&#8217;d by our virtues.</line>

The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD. DUM.</speaker>
<line>I have told your lordship already: the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood, he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk. He hath confess&#8217;d himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks; and what think you he hath confess&#8217;d?</line>

<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem</line>
<line>Was made much poorer by it; but your son,</line>

<line>Her estimation home.</line>

<line offset="5">&#8217;Tis past, my liege,</line>
<line>And I beseech your Majesty to make it</line>
<line>Natural rebellion, done i&#8217; th&#8217; blade of youth,</line>
<line>When oil and fire, too strong for reason&#8217;s force,</line>
<line>O&#8217;erbears it, and burns on.</line>

<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="6">My honor&#8217;d lady,</line>

<line offset="7">This I must say&#8212;</line>
<line>But first I beg my pardon&#8212;the young lord</line>
<line>Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady</line>
<line>Offense of mighty note; but to himself</line>
<line>The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</line>
<line>Whose beauty did astonish the survey</line>
<line>Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,</line>
<line>Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn&#8217;d to serve</line>
<line>Humbly call&#8217;d mistress.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Praising what is lost</line>
<line>Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither,</line>
<line>We are reconcil&#8217;d, and the first view shall kill</line>
<line>All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon,</line>
<line>The nature of his great offense is dead,</line>
<line>And deeper than oblivion we do bury</line>
<line>Th&#8217; incensing relics of it. Let him approach</line>
<line>A stranger, no offender; and inform him</line>

<line>All that he is hath reference to your Highness.</line>

<line offset="7">All is whole,</line>
<line>Not one word more of the consumed time.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s take the instant by the forward top;</line>
<line>For we are old, and on our quick&#8217;st decrees</line>
<line>Th&#8217; inaudible and noiseless foot of time</line>
<line>Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</line>
<line>The daughter of this lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line>Admiringly, my liege. At first</line>
<line>I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart</line>
<line>Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;</line>
<line>Where the impression of mine eye infixing,</line>
<line>Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,</line>
<line>Which warp&#8217;d the line of every other favor,</line>
<line>Scorn&#8217;d a fair color, or express&#8217;d it stol&#8217;n,</line>
<line>Extended or contracted all proportions</line>
<line>To a most hideous object. Thence it came</line>
<line>That she whom all men prais&#8217;d, and whom myself,</line>
<line>Since I have lost, have lov&#8217;d, was in mine eye</line>
<line>The dust that did offend it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Well excus&#8217;d.</line>
<line>That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away</line>
<line>From the great compt; but love that comes too late,</line>
<line>Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,</line>
<line>To the great sender turns a sour offense,</line>
<line>Crying, &#8220;That&#8217;s good that&#8217;s gone.&#8221; Our rash faults</line>
<line>Make trivial price of serious things we have,</line>
<line>Not knowing them until we know their grave.</line>
<line>Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,</line>
<line>Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;</line>
<line>Our own love waking cries to see what&#8217;s done,</line>
<line>While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.</line>
<line>Be this sweet Helen&#8217;s knell, and now forget her.</line>
<line>Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.</line>
<line>The main consents are had, and here we&#8217;ll stay</line>

<line>I saw upon her finger.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Hers it was not.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Now pray you let me see it; for mine eye,</line>
<line>While I was speaking, oft was fasten&#8217;d to&#8217;t.</line>
<line>This ring was mine, and when I gave it Helen,</line>
<line>I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood</line>
<line>Necessitied to help, that by this token</line>
<line>I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her</line>
<line>Of what should stead her most?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BER.</speaker>
<line offset="6">My gracious sovereign,</line>
<line>Howe&#8217;er it pleases you to take it so,</line>
<line>The ring was never hers.</line>

<line offset="5">Son, on my life,</line>

<line offset="4">I am sure I saw her wear it.</line>

<line>You are deceiv&#8217;d, my lord, she never saw it.</line>
<line>In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,</line>
<line>Wrapp&#8217;d in a paper, which contain&#8217;d the name</line>
<line>Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought</line>
<line>I stood engag&#8217;d; but when I had subscrib&#8217;d</line>
<line>To mine own fortune, and inform&#8217;d her fully</line>
<line>I could not answer in that course of honor</line>
<line>As she had made the overture, she ceas&#8217;d</line>
<line>In heavy satisfaction, and would never</line>
<line>Receive the ring again.</line>

<line>Whoever gave it you. Then if you know</line>
<line>That you are well acquainted with yourself,</line>
<line>Confess &#8217;twas hers, and by what rough enforcement</line>
<line>You got it from her. She call&#8217;d the saints to surety</line>
<line>That she would never put it from her finger,</line>
<line>Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,</line>
<line>Where you have never come, or sent it us</line>
<line>Upon her great disaster.</line>

<line offset="5">She never saw it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Thou speak&#8217;st it falsely, as I love mine honor,</line>
<line>And mak&#8217;st conjectural fears to come into me,</line>
<line>Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove</line>
<line>That thou art so inhuman&#8212;&#8217;twill not prove so;</line>
<line>And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,</line>
<line>And she is dead, which nothing but to close</line>
<line>Her eyes myself could win me to believe,</line>
<line>More than to see this ring. Take him away.</line>

<stagedir type="action">Guards seize Bertram.</stagedir>
<line>My fore-past proofs, howe&#8217;er the matter fall,</line>

<line>Here&#8217;s a petition from a Florentine,</line>

<line>Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know</line>

<line>Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them as I said, but more than that, he lov&#8217;d her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talk&#8217;d of Sathan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.</line>

<line>By Jove, if ever I knew man, &#8217;twas you.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore hast thou accus&#8217;d him all this while?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DIA.</speaker>
<line>Because he&#8217;s guilty, and he is not guilty.</line>
<line>He knows I am no maid, and he&#8217;ll swear to&#8217;t;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.</line>
<line>Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;</line>
<line>I am either maid, or else this old man&#8217;s wife.</line>

<line>Stay, royal sir.</line>
<line>The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,</line>
<line>And he shall surety me. But for this lord,</line>
<line>Who hath abus&#8217;d me, as he knows himself,</line>
<line>Though yet he never harm&#8217;d me, here I quit him.</line>
<line>He knows himself my bed he hath defil&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And at that time he got his wife with child.</line>
<line>Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.</line>
<line>So there&#8217;s my riddle: one that&#8217;s dead is quick&#8212;</line>

<line>O my good lord, when I was like this maid,</line>
<line>I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,</line>

<line>&#8220;When from my finger you can get this ring,</line>
<line>And are by me with child, etc.&#8221; This is done.</line>
<line>Will you be mine now you are doubly won?</line>

<line>If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,</line>

<line>If it appear not plain and prove untrue,</line>

<line>Thou kept&#8217;st a wife herself, thyself a maid.</line>
<line>Of that and all the progress, more and less,</line>
